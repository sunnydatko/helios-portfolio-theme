## Design

Helios draws its palette and mood from deep space — near-black backgrounds, cold blue-white accents, and a density that rewards attention without demanding it. The aesthetic is intentional:

- **Space-dark color palette** — rich near-black backgrounds offset by cool neutrals and precise accent hues that read like distant starlight
- **Ambient background** — a slow, living backdrop that shifts like light refracting through atmosphere
- **Typographic restraint** — Space Grotesk for headlines, Inter for body; hierarchy through weight and spacing, not decoration
- **Minimal chrome** — no sidebars, no noise, no gradients competing for attention; the work speaks, the interface recedes
- **Scroll-driven reveals** — content surfaces as you move through the page, each section arriving with quiet intention

---

## What's included

- **Hero** — headline, subhead, and social links
- **About** — personal bio and summary
- **Experience** — chronological work history with company, role, and highlights
- **Blog** — card grid of articles with individual post pages at `/blog/[slug]`
- **Contact** — inbound contact form
- **Scroll animations** — CSS-driven reveal system via Intersection Observer, no animation library required
- **SEO-ready** — server-side rendering, Metadata API, statically generated blog pages, optimized images

## Customization

All content lives in one file:

**`app/helpers/config.ts`**

```ts
export const social = [...]      // GitHub, LinkedIn, X
export const experience = [...]  // Work history
export const blogPosts = [...]   // Blog post metadata
export const education = [...]   // Education
```

The theme — colors, typography, dark mode — is in **`app/theme.ts`**.
